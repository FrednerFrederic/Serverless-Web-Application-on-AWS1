### Steps to Build the Project:

* Create a DynamoDB table to store the items. \
* Build a Lambda function to handle the CRUD operations on the DynamoDB table. \
* Use S3 to store and host the web application's static files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). \
* Create a CloudFront distribution to serve the S3-hosted static files with low latency. \

### Expected Outcome:

Upon completing the project, you will have a working serverless web application hosted on AWS. \
You will have hands-on experience building a serverless application using AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, CloudFront. \
Additionally, you will have experience working with AWS services and integrating them to build a complete solution.

This project will help you improve your skills in cloud computing, serverless architecture, and AWS services
